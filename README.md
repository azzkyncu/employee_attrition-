There are various reasons why employees leave companies. 
To establish an effective culture, companies seek ways to reduce attrition rates. 
Exit surveys, employee satisfaction surveys, and focus group interviews are widely used/conducted by companies to collect data from employees. 
For large quantitative datasets, machine learning algorithms are nice ways to see which variables play a significant role in employee attrition, in other words, predicting employee atrittion.
In this project, I will be using a dataset that has been publicly shared through Kaggle by IBM HR department. Here,I am trying to see whether or not I can predict employee attrition by applying some predictive modelling capabilites
Below are three sequence of stepts that I followed to answer my research question:
Exploratory Data Analysis : the feature distributions by Seaborn and Plotly visualisations
Feature Engineering and Categorical Encoding** : encode all our categorical features into dummy variables
Implementing Machine Learning models : Apply Random Forest and a Gradient Boosted Models
